# PiCamOLED
Code for displaying an image taken using a PiCam on Raspberry Pi onto a 128x64 I2C OLED Display. PiCamOLED.py allows for a picture to be taken when the R key is pressed and for the picture to be displayed upon pressing D. PiCamOLED2.py displays the images in real time with some lag due to processing limits of the Raspberry Pi
